@interface ARLabel : UILabel

// Note: The built-in UILabel adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth has its problems, that is
//       why ARLabel uses its own logic to apply the font size. If you want the
//       same functionallity also when the text is changing then remeber to set
//       the following property to YES.

// Set this property to YES to automatically adjust the font size of the text to fit
// current label frame on every text change. The default value is NO and the font size
// is calculated only the first time the text is set. The reason for this is better
// performance in the scenario that the label text is changed very frequently.
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL autoAdjustFontSizeWithTextChange;

// This property allows you to set a sort of template text to calculate the font
// size by, but which will never be displayed on the label. This is useful if you
// use fonts that do not have fixed and same letter widths, but you would like that
// all text that is going to be displayed on the label has the same font size.
// For example "05 Sep 2013" may not have the same width as "11 Jul 2013" so you may
// set this property to "88 mmm 8888" which has larger width than both of the two...
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *textForFontSizeCalculation;

// This property is responsible for better and clear looking text in case you are
// enlarging the size of the label greater than its initial size. If this property is
// not set the text is going to look blurry when enlarged. So set this to the maximum
// size you anticipate your label is going to change.
@property (assign, nonatomic) CGSize enlargedSize;
